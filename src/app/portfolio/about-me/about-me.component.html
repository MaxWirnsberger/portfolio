      <span>
        I am a Front-end developer based in Salzburg, Austria. I enjoy helping
        designers and companies bring their ideas into real life. I am looking
        forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a web developer
        position. <br />
        If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!
