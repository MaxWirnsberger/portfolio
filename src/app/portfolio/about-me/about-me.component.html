            I am a Front-end developer based in Salzburg, Austria. I enjoy
            helping designers and companies bring their ideas into real life. I
            am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a
            web developer position. <br />
            If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!
